# Advent of Code - 2025

## Introduction

This year there are only 12 days of puzzles. I will be trying to solve all puzzles the same day they release. I won't have much time to participate since I work 8 to 10 hours a day. I'm excited to share my results here. I will push the code I make for the solutions and a write up two days after the puzzle. This will be in the spirit of letting everyone come up with their own solutions first.

## Programming Language

I want to use something I am very familiar with, so this year I will use Python 3.14 for all the puzzles. This will make sure I can be the most efficient with my time. 

## Write Ups

I will be documenting my thought process while I code and sharing them here. Each day will have its own directory. The readme in each directory will be the write up for that day.
